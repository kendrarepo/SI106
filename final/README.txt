Final Project â€“ README
I. Type of project: 

   Pyglet project

II. Brief description of project:

    Diag Squirrel Dodger is a simple dodging game using Pyglet. As the player, you      
    are a squirrel and you must dodge the blue busses using the arrow keys. As the
    player, your goal is to avoid the blue busses for as long as you can. Your score 
    accumulates as long as you stay alive. Once you hit a blue bus, your score goes 
    back to zero. While playing, you are able to see both your current score and your
    high score. The fight song cheers you on in the background and if you get hit by a
    bus a horn honks at you.

III. List of files being turned in, with a brief description of each one:

     Files being turned in will include: a main final_project folder that contains all 
     resources needed to run the game. Inside there will be a file called test106.py
     that is needed for the test cases, as well as a game.py, which is the game itself,
     and the README file for the project along with images titled blebs.png and squirrel.png
     and sounds titled beep.wav and victors.wav that are needed for the game animations.

IV. Python packages/modules that need to be installed (e.g. BeautifulSoup):

    Pyglet and random.

V. Instructions for running/using/playing project:

First, you will need to place the files: beep.wav, bluebus.png,squirrel.png, and victors.wav
into a folder together and title it resources. This folder should be located in the same 
directory as the rest of the game elements. This is due to the way I wrote the code.

-- python game.py

The game is played by moving the squirrel with the right and left arrow keys. Your goal is to avoid
the blue busses for as long as possible. Press esc to exit the game window.


VII. Approximate line numbers in main python file to find following components (if they occur in another code file, note this):

Accumulation pattern
# 56-68

Sort with a key function	
# 112-115

Class definition
# 8
__init__() method for this class	
# 10-40
First method for this class	
# 42-46
Second method for this class	
# 48-53
Importation of a python module, either built-in or third-party	
# 1
Use of this module in the code:	
# 5-6 and all throughout the GameWindow class

Use of list comprehension OR map OR filter	
# 107-110

Definitions of 5 functions or methods (can include class methods above)	
# 1 55-68	
# 2 70-74	
# 3 76-80	
# 4 83-85	
# 5 87-88	

Test cases for at least three functions or methods	
# 1 94	
# 2 98	
# 3 102	


VIII. Rationale for project; why did you do this project? Why do you find it interesting?

I chose to do this project because I thought that it would be fun to create something that
my friends and family could interact with. My parents always enjoying hearing about what
I am doing in class, so now they can actually experience one of my programs!
