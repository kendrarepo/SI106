## Starting with the basepong, make a Breakout game.

# 1) Make a 1-player Pong game where the right-most wall just relfects the ball back intead of scoring a point.
  # We have already changed the ball's starting position and angle. You'll only need to make changes to
  # Game.__init__
  # Hints on how to do this:
  # How can you remove the second player's paddle?
  # How can you make the right-hand wall deflect the ball back instead of scoring a point? (Hint: make it
  # an instance of a different class.)

# 2) Make a 6-deep floor-to-ceiling barricade of bricks on the right side, analogous to the maze walls we created in
  # lecture. Test this to make sure it works before going on. Some thoughts on how go about this:
  # -- how would you make one column of bricks, using a for loop? The x position will be fixed, but the y position
  #    will get larger with each successive iteration. You can calculate how many bricks are needed, and thus how
  #    times to iterate, by dividing the window height by the height of a brick.
  # -- how would you make a set of six columns? Another for loop, iterating six times. On each iteration the x position
  #    is larger, and then you use the inner loop to create one column of bricks.

# 3) Make bricks disappear when hit by making a Brick subclass of BallDeflector and 
  # switching your bricks from problem 2 to be instances of Brick instead of BallDeflector.
  # Test this to see if the bricks disappear after they are hit.
  # Hints on how to do this:
  # -- Make the Brick subclass
  # -- Create a deflect_ball() method for it. In that method:
  #    -- call the parent class' deflect_ball() method, so that the balls deflects normally
  #    -- get the game's list of game_objects, and call the .remove() method on it to remove the current brick. 
  #       That way, when the game tells all of it's game_objects to dispaly themselves, this brick won't display. 
  #       Also, when the ball tries to see if it's run into any other game objects, it won't check with this 
  #       brick any more.
  # -- Make the bricks be instances of the new class instead of the BallDeflector class.

# 4) Keep track of how many bricks have been hit. Every 10th brick, increase the ball velocity.
  # HINT: you did something like this in section, making the ball speed up on every 4th hit by a paddle.
